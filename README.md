# Desktop-Cleaner
A short python script containing several different functions used to remove clutter from a users desktop by moving files to specified directories based on thier file type.

Before running, you must specify the directories you want to use in the variables within the script.
For example: 
  source_directory = r'C:/Users/johndoe/Desktop'
  image_directory = r'C:/Users/johndoe/Documents/images'   
Then simply uncomment the lines at the bottom of the script containing the cleaners you want to use.
